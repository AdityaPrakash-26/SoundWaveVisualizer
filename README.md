# SoundWaveVisualizer
Visual sound clips using bars

Made in UE4. If you're looking to see how I implemented this, you can check out just the SpectralVisualizer.cpp and SpectralVisualizer.h files. The other files are pretty much the default ones. 

You will need Unreal Engine version 4.25.3 to open this.
